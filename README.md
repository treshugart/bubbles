# Bubbles

> A React SSR SPA framework built on top of Parcel.

Current features:

- Builds via Parcel.
- Pre-fetch using a _non-blocking_ `getInitialProps()` on the client.
- Server uses [Koa](https://github.com/koajs/koa).
- Client router uses [Navaid](https://github.com/lukeed/navaid).

Future plans:

- Use Parcel to build the server files (currently uses Babel) to seamless universal features.
- Monorepo / workspaces support.

## Installing

> This is currently under development and isn't installable via NPM yet.
